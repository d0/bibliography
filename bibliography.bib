  abstract = {Security of wireless mesh networks (WMNs) is critical for their deployment
	and management. To provide the fundamental user authentication, access
	control and transmission confidentiality services, authentication
	and key agreement (AKA) is the crucial issue. In this paper, ECC-
	based self-certified public key cryptosystem (ECCSCPKC) is introduced
	for constructing WMNs security infrastructure; and its related security
	schemes, with a few modifications, are used for designing the AKA
	protocol. The proposed scheme supports an efficient authentication
	and key agreement between a mesh client and a mesh router, with less
	cost of communication and computation resources as well as system
	maintenance.},

	wireless mesh networks. Uses an offline CA (fully trusted) to issue
	self certified public keys. Key Agreement used to establish HMAC
	key, seperate authenticated encryption. All protocols are non interactive.
	System parameters announced via beacons by mesh routers. Only discusses
	communication between routers and clients (single hop), no router-to-router
	or multihop. Routers are fully trusted (no intrusion tolerance).
	No key revocation (but session keys are ephemeral). No simulation
	or implementation, security considerations and performance discussions
	are high-level without proofs.},
