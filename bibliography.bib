	encrypted messages over the Internet. However, it necessarily requires
	an entity known as a private-key generator (PKG), which can create

	communications. Although a distributed private key generator has
	been suggested as a way to mitigate this problem, to date there have
	been no practical designs proposed for one. This paper presents the
	first realistic architecture for a distributed private-key generator
	for use over the Internet.
	
	We attack and improve the proactive verifiable secret sharing scheme
	by Herzberg et al. to define periodic master-key modification and
	secret share recovery protocols for our architecture. Our periodic
	master-key modification achieves forward secrecy of the master key;
	this feature has been missing in other proactive security schemes,
	but is of great importance in identity-based applications. We realize
	the utility of modifying the set of nodes in a distributed PKG and
	we present protocols for redundancy node addition and security node
	addition. We also compare our architecture to other verifiable secret
	sharing architectures for the Internet and demonstrate that ours
